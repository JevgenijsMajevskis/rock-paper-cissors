# rock-paper-scissors

JavaScript project created by Jevgenijs Majevskis and powered by The Odin Project.

    Console game:

The idea of this project was to make a console Rock Paper Scissors game where any user can play against computer. After a 5 round game a winner will be declared.

Plan for the first phase (aka. console game):

1. Create a function computersSelection that will randomly return either 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissors';
2. Create a function playerSelection that will allow player to make a choice;
3. Write a function that plays one round and declare a winner;
4. Create a function with the loop that will play five rounds and declare a winner at the very end.

P.S. the JavaScript file is saved inside consoleScript.js located in the consoleGame directory.

    UI game:

It is the same Rock, Paper, Scissors game, but with the styled user interface (or simply webpage), where player can choose one of three buttons with different choices. Compute still choose randomly.

The score is displayed on the screen, but after five rounds only one of two can be maned a WINNER!

In order to make this work, the plane script.js was used, however some of the function from the previous phase were still useful.
