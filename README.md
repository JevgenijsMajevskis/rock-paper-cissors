# rock-paper-cissors

JavaScript project created by Jevgenijs Majevskis and powered by The Odin Project. First attempt to create a working webpage with JavaScript. 

The idea of this project was to make a console Rock Paper Scissors game where any user can play against computer. After a 5 roung game a winner will be declared. Later this game will be transformed into a complete good looking browsere one.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Plan for the first phase (aka. console game):

1. Create a function computersSelection that will randomly return either 'Rock', 'Paper' or 'Scissos';
2. Create a function playerSelection that will allow player to make a choice;
3. Write a function that plays one round and declare a winner;
4. Create a function with the loop that will play five rounds and declare a winner at hte very end.
