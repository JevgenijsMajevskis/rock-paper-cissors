# rock-paper-cissors
JavaScript project created by Jevgenijs Majevskis and powered by The Odin Project.

First attempt to create a working webpage with JavaScript. The idea of this project was to make a console Rock Paper Scissors game where any user can play against computer. After a 5 roung game a winner will be declared.

Later this game will be transformed into a complete good looking browsere one.
